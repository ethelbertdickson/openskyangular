Install Node.js and npm: Angular requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your machine. 
You can download and install Node.js from the official website # (https://nodejs.org/en/). npm comes with Node.js by default, 
so you don't need to install it separately.

To install Angular CLI, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

npm install -g @angular/cli

Clone the repository: Once you have installed Angular CLI, 
you can clone the Angular repository that you want to run on your local machine.
