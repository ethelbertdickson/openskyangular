Install Node.js and npm: Angular requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your machine. 
You can download and install Node.js from the official website # (https://nodejs.org/en/). npm comes with Node.js by default, 
so you don't need to install it separately.

Install Angular CLI: Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps you create, build, and run Angular applications. 
To install Angular CLI, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

npm install -g @angular/cli

Clone the repository: Once you have installed Angular CLI, 
you can clone the Angular repository that you want to run on your local machine. 
To clone the repository, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the repository that you want to clone.

Install dependencies: After cloning the repository, 
navigate to the project directory and install the project dependencies by running the following command:

npm install

This command installs all the dependencies required by the Angular project.

Run the project: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Angular project by running the following command:

ng serve


This command builds the project and starts a development server. 
You can then open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the running Angular application.
