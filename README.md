# Install Node.js and npm: Angular requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your machine. 
# You can download and install Node.js from the official website # (https://nodejs.org/en/). npm comes with Node.js by default, 
# so you don't need to install it separately.

# Install Angular CLI: Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps you create, build, and run Angular applications. 
# To install Angular CLI, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

# npm install -g @angular/cli

# Clone the repository: Once you have installed Angular CLI, 
# you can clone the Angular repository that you want to run on your local machine. 
# To clone the repository, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

# git clone <repository_url>
# Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the repository that you want to clone.

# Install dependencies: After cloning the repository, 
# navigate to the project directory and install the project dependencies by running the following command:

# npm install

# This command installs all the dependencies required by the Angular project.

# Run the project: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Angular project by running the following command:

# ng serve


# This command builds the project and starts a development server. 
# You can then open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the running Angular application.


# The login component has the following credentials: 
# Username = admin
# Password = password




# This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
